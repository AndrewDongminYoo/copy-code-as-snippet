- Clipboard-ready output for pasting into docs, chats, or markdown editors

   - Right-click in the editor and select "Copy Code as Snippet" (if added to context menu)
3. The snippet will be copied to your clipboard in the selected format:

<details>
<summary>Example (Markdown with file path)</summary>

```typescript:src/extension.ts
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // ...
